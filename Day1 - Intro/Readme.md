# Intro

JavaScript is a popular programming language that has a wide range of applications.

JavaScript was previously used mainly for making webpages interactive such as form validation, animation, etc. Nowadays, JavaScript is also used in many other areas such as server-side development, mobile app development and so on.

Because of its wide range of applications, you can run JavaScript in several ways:

## Using Console Tab of Web Browsers

All the popular web browsers have built-in JavaScript engines. Hence, you can run JavaScript on a browser. To run JavaScript on a browser,

- On the developer tools, go to the console tab. Then, write JavaScript code and press enter to run the code.

## Printing in console

We use web console to print:
```
console.log("Hello world")
```
