        /* write the definiton of comments in multi - line comments
 
        JavaScript comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. 
        They are completely ignored by JavaScript engines.

        There are two ways to add comments to code:

        Single Line Comments
        Multi-line Comments

        In JavaScript, any line that starts with // is a single line comment.

        Multiline comments are used for large text descriptions of code or 
        to comment out chunks of code while debugging applications.
        Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */
 
        // Syntax 
                    /*
                        comment for multiline
                    */

                    // comment for single line
    </script>
