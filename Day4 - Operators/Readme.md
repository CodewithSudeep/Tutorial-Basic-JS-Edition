# What is an Operator?
In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables). For example,
```
2 + 3; // 5
```
Here + is an operator that performs addition, and 2 and 3 are operands.

## JavaScript Operator Types
Here is a list of different operators you will learn in this tutorial.

#### Assignment Operators
#### Arithmetic Operators
#### Comparison Operators
#### Logical Operators
#### Bitwise Operators
#### String Operators
#### Other Operators

## JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. For example,

```
const x = 5;
```

Here, the = operator is used to assign value 5 to variable x.

Here's a list of commonly used assignment operators:

#### =	
Assignment operator	
```
a = 7; // 7
```

#### +=	
Addition assignment	
```
a += 5; // a = a + 5
```

#### -=	
Subtraction Assignment	
```
a -= 2; // a = a - 2
```

#### *=	
Multiplication Assignment	
```
a *= 3; // a = a * 3
```

#### /=	
Division Assignment	
```
a /= 2; // a = a / 2
```

#### %=	
Remainder Assignment	
```
a %= 2; // a = a % 2
```

##### **=	
Exponentiation Assignment	
```
a **= 2; // a = a**2
```

```
Note: The commonly used assignment operator is =. You will understand other assignment operators such as +=, -=, *= etc. once we learn arithmetic operators.
```

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic calculations. For example,

```
const number = 3 + 5; // 8
```

Here, the + operator is used to add two operands.


> 	Addition	x + y
>	Subtraction	x - y
>	Multiplication	x * y
>	Division	x / y
>	Remainder	x % y
>	Increment (increments by 1)	++x or x++
>	Decrement (decrements by 1)	--x or x-- 
>	Exponentiation (Power)	x ** y

#### Example 1: Arithmetic operators in JavaScript
```
let x = 5;
let y = 3;

// addition
console.log('x + y = ', x + y);  // 8

// subtraction
console.log('x - y = ', x - y);  // 2

// multiplication
console.log('x * y = ', x * y);  // 15

// division
console.log('x / y = ', x / y);  // 1.6666666666666667

// remainder
console.log('x % y = ', x % y);   // 2

// increment
console.log('++x = ', ++x); // x is now 6
console.log('x++ = ', x++); // prints 6 and then increased to 7
console.log('x = ', x);     // 7

// decrement
console.log('--x = ', --x); // x is now 6
console.log('x-- = ', x--); // prints 6 and then decreased to 5
console.log('x = ', x);     // 5

//exponentiation
console.log('x ** y =', x ** y);

```

>Note: The ** operator was introduced in ECMAScript 2016 and some browsers may not support them. To learn more, visit JavaScript exponentiation browser support.

## JavaScript Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, either true or false. For example,
```
const a = 3, b = 2;
console.log(a > b); // true 
```

>Here, the comparison operator > is used to compare whether a is greater than b.


> ==	Equal to: returns true if the operands are equal	x == y
> !=	Not equal to: returns true if the operands are not equal	x != y
> ===	Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type	x === y
> !==	Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all	x !== y
>	Greater than: true if left operand is greater than the right operand	x > y
>=	Greater than or equal to: true if left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand	x >= y
> <	Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand	x < y
> <=	Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand	x <= y

#### Example 2: Comparison operators in JavaScript
```
// equal operator
console.log(2 == 2); // true
console.log(2 == '2'); // true

// not equal operator
console.log(3 != 2); // true
console.log('hello' != 'Hello'); // true

// strict equal operator
console.log(2 === 2); // true
console.log(2 === '2'); // false

// strict not equal operator
console.log(2 !== '2'); // true
console.log(2 !== 2); // false
```
> Comparison operators are used in decision-making and loops. You will learn about the use of comparison operators in detail in later tutorials.

## JavaScript Logical Operators
Logical operators perform logical operations and return a boolean value, either true or false. For example,
```
const x = 5, y = 3;
(x < 6) && (y < 5); // true
```
> Here, && is the logical operator AND. Since both x < 6 and y < 5 are true, the result is true.


> &&	Logical AND: true if both the operands are true, else returns false	x && y
> ||	Logical OR: true if either of the operands is true; returns false if both are false	x || y
> !	Logical NOT: true if the operand is false and vice-versa.	!x

#### Example 3: Logical Operators in JavaScript
```
// logical AND
console.log(true && true); // true
console.log(true && false); // false

// logical OR
console.log(true || false); // true

// logical NOT
console.log(!true); // false
Output

true
false
true
false
```

## JavaScript Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.


-  ```&```	Bitwise AND
- ```|```	Bitwise OR
- ```^```	Bitwise XOR
- ```~```	Bitwise NOT
- ``<<``	Left shift
- ```>>```	Sign-propagating right shift
- ```>>>```	Zero-fill right shift

## JavaScript String Operators
In JavaScript, you can also use the + operator to concatenate (join) two or more strings.

#### Example 4: String operators in JavaScript
```
// concatenation operator
console.log('hello' + 'world');

let a = 'JavaScript';

a += ' tutorial';  // a = a + ' tutorial';
console.log(a);
Output

helloworld
JavaScript tutorial
```

>Note: When + is used with strings, it performs concatenation. However, when + is used with numbers, it performs addition.

## Other JavaScript Operators
Here's a list of other operators available in JavaScript. You will learn about these operators in later tutorials.

- ```,```	evaluates multiple operands and returns the value of the last operand.```	let a = (1, 3 , 4); // 4```

- ```?:```	returns value based on the condition	```(5 > 3) ? 'success' : 'error'; // "success"```
- ```delete```	deletes an object's property, or an element of an array	```delete x```
- ```typeof```	returns a string indicating the data type	```typeof 3; // "number"```
- ``void``	discards the expression's return value	```void(x)```
- ```in```	returns true if the specified property is in the object	prop in object
- ```instanceof```	returns true if the specified object is of of the specified object type	object instanceof object_type
